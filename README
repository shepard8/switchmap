This little script allows to switch between different keymaps.

Currently everything is hardcoded. If you wish to use it for your own needs, you have two options :
- Change the available keymaps; or
- create a generic solution that supports easy configuration for future users.

Once the script is tailored to your needs, you can integrate it with i3/i3status as follows:

Assuming you cloned the repository into ~/.local/switchmap

Make script executable :

	chmod +x ~/.local/switchmap/switchmap.sh

Configure i3status :

	~/.config/i3status/config

		order += "read_file keymap"

		read_file keymap {
			path = "~/.local/switchmap/map"
		}

Configure i3 :

	~/.config/i3/config

		bindsym $mod+m exec ~/.local/switchmap/switchmap.sh
